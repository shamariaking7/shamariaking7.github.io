                <h1>Orange (fruit)</h1>
                <i>"Orange peel"</i> redirects here. For other uses, see 
                Orange peel (disambiguation).
                <p>
                    The <b>orange</b>, also called <b>sweet orange</b> to 
                    distinguish it from the bitter orange (Citrus - aurantium), 
                    is the fruit of a tree in the family Rutaceae. Botanically, 
                    this is the hybrid Citrus - sinensis, between the pomelo 
                    (Citrus maxima) and the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata). 
                    The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, 
                    is that of pomelo. There are many related hybrids including 
                    of mandarins and sweet orange. The sweet orange has had 
                    its full genome sequenced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern 
                    China, Northeast India, and Myanmar; the earliest mention 
                    of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. 
                    Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical 
                    areas for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree 
                    can be eaten fresh or processed for its juice or fragrant 
                    peel. In 2022, 76 million tonnes of oranges were grown 
                    worldwide, with Brazil producing 22% of the total, 
                    followed by India and China.

                    Oranges, variously understood, have featured in human 
                    culture since ancient times. They first appear in Western 
                    art in the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, but they 
                    had been depicted in Chinese art centuries earlier, as 
                    in Zhao Lingrang's Song dynasty fan painting Yellow 
                    Oranges and Green Tangerines. By the 17th century, an 
                    orangery had become an item of prestige in Europe, as 
                    seen at the Versailles Orangerie. More recently, artists 
                    such as Vincent van Gogh, John Sloan, and Henri Matisse 
                    included oranges in their paintings.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The orange tree is a relatively small evergreen, 
                    flowering tree, with an average height of 9 to 10 m 
                    (30 to 33 ft), although some very old specimens can 
                    reach 15 m (49 ft).[1] Its oval leaves, which are 
                    alternately arranged, are 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in) 
                    long and have crenulate margins.[2] Sweet oranges grow 
                    in a range of different sizes, and shapes varying from 
                    spherical to oblong. Inside and attached to the rind is 
                    a porous white tissue, the white, bitter mesocarp or 
                    albedo (pith).[3] The orange contains a number of 
                    distinct carpels (segments or pigs, botanically the 
                    fruits) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by 
                    a membrane and containing many juice-filled vesicles and 
                    usually a few pips. When unripe, the fruit is green. The
                    grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from 
                    bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains 
                    green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains 
                    entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet
                    orange is non-climacteric, not ripening off the tree. 
                    The Citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes 
                    with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or 
                    pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.
                    [4][5][6] The fruit is a hesperidium, a modified berry; 
                    it is covered by a rind formed by a rugged thickening 
                    of the ovary wall.[7][8]

                <h3>History</h3>
                <h4>Hybrid origins</h4>
                <p>
                    Citrus trees are angiosperms, and most species are 
                    almost entirely interfertile. This includes grapefruits, 
                    lemons, limes, oranges, and many citrus hybrids. As the 
                    interfertility of oranges and other citrus has produced 
                    numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have 
                    also been selected, citrus taxonomy has proven difficult.
                    [9]
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sweet orange, Citrus x sinensis,[10] is not a wild 
                    fruit, but arose in domestication in East Asia. It 
                    originated in a region encompassing Southern China, 
                    Northeast India,[11] and Myanmar.[12] The fruit was 
                    created as a cross between a non-pure mandarin orange 
                    and a hybrid pomelo that had a substantial mandarin 
                    component.[13][14] Since its chloroplast DNA is that of 
                    pomelo, it was likely the hybrid pomelo, perhaps a pomelo 
                    BC1 backcross, that was the maternal parent of the first 
                    orange.[15][16] Based on genomic analysis, the relative 
                    proportions of the ancestral species in the sweet orange 
                    are approximately 42% pomelo and 58% mandarin.[17] All 
                    varieties of the sweet orange descend from this prototype 
                    cross, differing only by mutations selected for during 
                    agricultural propagation.[16] Sweet oranges have a distinct 
                    origin from the bitter orange, which arose independently, 
                    perhaps in the wild, from a cross between pure mandarin 
                    and pomelo parents.[16]

                <h4>Arab Agricultural Revolution</h4>  
                <p>
                    In Europe, the Moors introduced citrus fruits including 
                    the bitter orange, lemon, and lime to Al-Andalus in the 
                    Iberian Peninsula during the Arab Agricultural 
                    Revolution.[20] Large-scale cultivation started in the 
                    10th century, as evidenced by complex irrigation 
                    techniques specifically adapted to support orange 
                    orchards.[21][20] Citrus fruits—among them the bitter 
                    orange—were introduced to Sicily in the 9th century 
                    during the period of the Emirate of Sicily, but the 
                    sweet orange was unknown there until the late 15th 
                    century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when 
                    Italian and Portuguese merchants brought orange trees 
                    into the Mediterranean area.[11]
                </p>
                <h4>Spread across Europe</h4>
                <p>
                    Shortly afterward, the sweet orange quickly was adopted 
                    as an edible fruit. It was considered a luxury food 
                    grown by wealthy people in private conservatories, 
                    called orangeries. By 1646, the sweet orange was well 
                    known throughout Europe; it went on to become the most 
                    often cultivated of all fruit trees.[11] Louis XIV of 
                    France had a great love of orange trees and built the 
                    grandest of all royal Orangeries at the Palace of 
                    Versailles.[22] At Versailles, potted orange trees in 
                    solid silver tubs were placed throughout the rooms of 
                    the palace, while the Orangerie allowed year-round 
                    cultivation of the fruit to supply the court. When 
                    Louis condemned his finance minister, Nicolas Fouquet, 
                    in 1664, part of the treasures that he confiscated were 
                    over 1,000 orange trees from Fouquet's estate at 
                    Vaux-le-Vicomte.[23]

                <h4>Nutrition</h4>
                <p>
                    Orange flesh is 87% water, 12% carbohydrates, 1% 
                    protein, and contains negligible fat (see table). As a 
                    100-gram reference amount, orange flesh provides 47 
                    calories, and is a rich source of vitamin C, providing 
                    64% of the Daily Value. No other micronutrients are 
                    present in significant amounts (see table).
                </p>
                <h4>Phytochemicals</h4>
                <p>
                    Oranges contain diverse phytochemicals, including 
                    carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein and beta-
                    cryptoxanthin), flavonoids (e.g. naringenin)[39] and 
                    numerous volatile organic compounds producing orange 
                    aroma, including aldehydes, esters, terpenes, alcohols, 
                    and ketones.[40] Orange juice contains only about 
                    one-fifth the citric acid of lime or lemon juice 
                    (which contain about 47 g/L).[41]
