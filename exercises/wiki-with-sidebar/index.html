                <h1>Orange (fruit)</h1>
                <i>"Orange peel"</i> redirects here. For other uses, see 
                    Orange peel (disambiguation).
                <p>
                   The <b>orange</b>, also called <b>sweet orange</b> to 
                   distinguish it from the bitter orange (Citrus - aurantium), 
                   is the fruit of a tree in the family Rutaceae. Botanically, 
                   this is the hybrid Citrus - sinensis, between the pomelo 
                   (Citrus maxima) and the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata). 
                   The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, 
                   is that of pomelo. There are many related hybrids including 
                   of mandarins and sweet orange. The sweet orange has had 
                   its full genome sequenced.
                </p>

                   The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern 
                   China, Northeast India, and Myanmar; the earliest mention 
                   of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC. 
                   Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical 
                   areas for their sweet fruit. The fruit of the orange tree 
                   can be eaten fresh or processed for its juice or fragrant 
                   peel. In 2022, 76 million tonnes of oranges were grown 
                   worldwide, with Brazil producing 22% of the total, 
                   followed by India and China.

                    Oranges, variously understood, have featured in human 
                    culture since ancient times. They first appear in Western 
                    art in the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, but they 
                    had been depicted in Chinese art centuries earlier, as 
                    in Zhao Lingrang's Song dynasty fan painting Yellow 
                    Oranges and Green Tangerines. By the 17th century, an 
                    orangery had become an item of prestige in Europe, as 
                    seen at the Versailles Orangerie. More recently, artists 
                    such as Vincent van Gogh, John Sloan, and Henri Matisse 
                    included oranges in their paintings.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    The orange tree is a relatively small evergreen, 
                    flowering tree, with an average height of 9 to 10 m 
                    (30 to 33 ft), although some very old specimens can 
                    reach 15 m (49 ft).[1] Its oval leaves, which are 
                    alternately arranged, are 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in) 
                    long and have crenulate margins.[2] Sweet oranges grow 
                    in a range of different sizes, and shapes varying from 
                    spherical to oblong. Inside and attached to the rind is 
                    a porous white tissue, the white, bitter mesocarp or 
                    albedo (pith).[3] The orange contains a number of 
                    distinct carpels (segments or pigs, botanically the 
                    fruits) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by 
                    a membrane and containing many juice-filled vesicles and 
                    usually a few pips. When unripe, the fruit is green. The
                    grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from 
                    bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains 
                    green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains 
                    entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet
                    orange is non-climacteric, not ripening off the tree. 
                    The Citrus sinensis group is subdivided into four classes 
                    with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or 
                    pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.
                    [4][5][6] The fruit is a hesperidium, a modified berry; 
                    it is covered by a rind formed by a rugged thickening 
                    of the ovary wall.[7][8]
