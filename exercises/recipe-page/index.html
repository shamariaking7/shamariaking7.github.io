            <h4>MAKE THE ORANGE GLAZE</h4>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Start by making the orange glaze. In a saucepan, combine 
                    the coconut aminos, orange juice, rice vinegar, brown sugar
                    ,sesame oil, garlic, ginger paste, and red pepper flakes.
                    Bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat. Then reduce the 
                    heat to low.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    In a small bowl, whisk together the water and cornstarch 
                    until smooth. then slowly pour it into the bubbling sauce 
                    while stirring.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Let it simmer for a few minutes until thick, glossy, and 
                    coats the back of a spoon. Turn off the heat and set it
                    aside while you fry the chicken.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>BREADING & FRYING THE CHICKEN</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Cut the boneless, skinless thighs into bite-sized pieces.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    In a large Ziploc bag, add the gluten-free flour,
                    cornstarch, salt, and black pepper. Seal the bag and shake 
                    it to mix everything together.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    In a bowl, beat the eggs and season with salt and pepper. 
                    Dip all the chicken pieces into the egg mixture, then
                    transfer them straight into the Ziploc bag.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Seal it up and shake it all around until every piece is 
                    fully coated.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Heat a pot of vegetable oil over medium heat until it 
                    reaches 350Â°F. Fry the chicken in batches, making sure not 
                    to overcrowd the pot. Cook each batch for about 5 to 6 
                    minutes until golden, crispy, and fully cooked through. 
                    Transfer to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Once all the chicken is done, toss it in the warm orange 
                    glaze until each piece is coated and glistening.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle with sliced green onions and sesame seeds if you 
                    want, then dig in while it's hot and crispy!
                </li>
