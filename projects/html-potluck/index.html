            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <h4>STEAK</h4>
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>1 pound thinly shaved steak</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
            <li>1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup beef broth</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <h4>VEGGIES</h4>
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>1/2 large yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil</li>
            <li>salt, to taste</li>
            <li>black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon minced garlic</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            <h4>FOR ASSEMBLY</h4>
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>12-pack Hawaiian rolls</li>
            <li>mayonnaise, for toasting bread (optional)</li>
            <li>
            4 to 6 slices cheese (Cooper Sharp, provolone, or cheese wiz)</li>
            <li>melted unsalted butter, for brushing tops</li>
            <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <h1>Instructions</h1>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>
                    <b>Cook the Veggies:</b> In a pan over medium heat, add 
                    neutral oil. Once hot, toss in the diced onion and 
                    sliced bell pepper. Season with a pinch of salt and 
                    black pepper. Sauté until softened and slightly 
                    caramelized, about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the minced 
                    garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes until fragrant. 
                    Remove from the pan and set aside.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>
                    <b>Cook the Steak:</b>  In the same pan, melt butter 
                    with neutral oil over medium-high heat. Add the shaved 
                    steak, breaking it apart as it cooks. Season with salt, 
                    paprika, mustard powder, and black pepper. Once the 
                    steak is browned, pour in Worcestershire sauce and cook 
                    for another minute. Then, pour in the beef broth to 
                    deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits for extra 
                    flavor. Let it simmer for 2 minutes until slightly 
                    reduced. Remove from heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Prepare the Rolls:</b> Preheat the oven to 350°F 
                    (175°C). Keeping the Hawaiian rolls connected, slice 
                    them in half horizontally. Spread a thin layer of 
                    mayonnaise on the cut sides. Place them mayo-side up on 
                    a baking sheet and toast in the oven for a few minutes 
                    until lightly golden.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Assemble the Sliders:</b> Place the bottom half of 
                    the toasted rolls in a baking dish or tray. Evenly 
                    spread the cooked steak over the bread, then layer the 
                    sautéed veggies on top. Add your choice of Cooper Sharp, 
                    provolone, or Cheese Whiz over the veggies. Place the 
                    top half of the rolls on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Finish and Bake:</b> Brush the tops with melted 
                    butter and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. Cover 
                    loosely with foil and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until 
                    the cheese is melted. Then, remove the foil and bake 
                    for another 5 minutes until the tops are golden brown.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Serve:</b> Let the sliders cool slightly before 
                    pulling them apart. Enjoy warm!

            <li>3 large russet potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt (for roasting)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper (for roasting)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whole milk, hot</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt (for mashed potatoes), more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper (for mashed potatoes)</li>
            <li>6 slices beef bacon, each cut in half</li>
            <li>¾ cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper, to taste</li>

        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>
                    <b>Bake the Potatoes</b> - Preheat the oven to 400°F 
                    (200°C). Scrub the russet potatoes clean, then use a fork 
                    to poke holes all around each potato to allow for even 
                    roasting. Rub them with avocado oil, salt, and black 
                    pepper. Place them directly on the oven rack and bake for 
                    about 50-60 minutes, or until fork-tender. Let them cool 
                    slightly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Prepare the Filling</b> - Slice each potato in half 
                    lengthwise and scoop out most of the inside, leaving a 
                    sturdy shell. In a bowl, mash the scooped potatoes with 
                    butter, hot milk, salt, and black pepper until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Assemble</b> - Spoon most of the mashed potatoes back 
                    into the shells, pressing down in the center to create a 
                    well. Place two halved slices of beef bacon in each well, 
                    sprinkle with shredded cheddar, and carefully crack an egg 
                    on top. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Bake Again</b> - Return the stuffed potatoes to the oven 
                    and bake at 350°F (190°C) for 15-20 minutes, or until the 
                    egg whites are set but the yolks are still slightly runny.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Serve & Enjoy</b> - Let them cool for a couple of 
                    minutes, then dig in and enjoy this perfect breakfast bite!

            don't rush it—it's totally worth the wait!

        <ul>
            <li>2 cups chopped dates (packed)</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>
            1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed black cardamom, more or less to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <h1>Instructions</h1>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>
                    In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the chopped dates 
                    and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let the mixture cook for 50 minutes to 1 hour, stirring 
                    occasionally, until the dates soften and break down. The 
                    longer it simmers, the deeper the flavor. You can even cook 
                    it down longer for 1 hour and a half to 2 hours for a 
                    deeper more sweet syrup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth
                    , pressing the dates to extract as much liquid as possible. 
                    Discard the solids.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return the strained liquid to the saucepan and cook over 
                    low heat, stirring occasionally, until it reduces and 
                    thickens into a syrup. This can take 
                    <b>
                        30 to 45 minutes
                    </b>
                    , but for a richer and thicker syrup, let it simmer 
                    for up to <b>an hour or more.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the crushed black cardamom and optional vanilla, 
                    adding in more or less to your taste, and let it infuse for 
                    5 minutes before removing from heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Allow the syrup to cool and store in a sealed jar in the 
                    fridge for up to two weeks.
